~plz~ is an HTTP library for Emacs.  It uses ~curl~ as a backend, which avoids some of the issues with using Emacs's built-in ~url~ library.  It supports both synchronous and asynchronous requests.  Its API is intended to be simple, natural, and expressive.  Its code is intended to be simple and well-organized.  Every feature is tested against [[https://httpbin.org/][httpbin]].

* Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      :depth 0
:END:

** GNU ELPA

~plz~ is available in [[http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/plz.html][GNU ELPA]].  It may be installed in Emacs using the ~package-install~ command.

** Manual

 ~plz~ has no dependencies other than Emacs and ~curl~.  It's known to work on Emacs 26.3 or later.  To install it manually, simply place =plz.el= in your ~load-path~ and ~(require 'plz)~.

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      :depth 1
:END:

The main public function is ~plz~, which sends an HTTP request and returns either the result of the specified type (for a synchronous request), or the ~curl~ process object (for asynchronous requests).  For asynchronous requests, callback, error-handling, and finalizer functions may be specified, as well as various other options.

** Examples

Synchronously =GET= a URL and return the response body as a decoded string (here, raw JSON):

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :exports both :results value code :cache yes
  (plz 'get "https://httpbin.org/user-agent")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  "{\n \"user-agent\": \"curl/7.35.0\"\n}\n"
#+END_SRC

Synchronously =GET= a URL that returns a JSON object, and parse and return it as an alist:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :exports both :results value code :cache yes
  (plz 'get "https://httpbin.org/get" :as #'json-read)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  ((args)
   (headers
    (Accept . "*/*")
    (Accept-Encoding . "deflate, gzip")
    (Host . "httpbin.org")
    (User-Agent . "curl/7.35.0"))
   (url . "https://httpbin.org/get"))
#+END_SRC

Asynchronously =POST= a JSON object in the request body, then parse a JSON object from the response body, and call a function with the result:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :exports both :cache yes
  (plz 'post "https://httpbin.org/post"
    :headers '(("Content-Type" . "application/json"))
    :body (json-encode '(("key" . "value")))
    :as #'json-read
    :then (lambda (alist)
            (message "Result: %s" (alist-get 'data alist))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Result: {"key":"value"}

Synchronously download a JPEG file, then create an Emacs image object from the data:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :exports both :cache yes
  (let ((jpeg-data (plz 'get "https://httpbin.org/image/jpeg" :as 'binary)))
    (create-image jpeg-data nil 'data))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: (image :type jpeg :data ""ÿØÿà^@^PJFIF...")

** Functions

+  ~plz~ :: /(method url &key headers body else finally noquery (as 'string) (then 'sync) (body-type 'text) (decode t decode-s) (connect-timeout plz-connect-timeout) (timeout plz-timeout))/

   Request ~METHOD~ from ~URL~ with curl.  Return the curl process object or, for a synchronous request, the selected result.

   ~HEADERS~ may be an alist of extra headers to send with the request.

   ~BODY-TYPE~ may be ~text~ to send ~BODY~ as text, or ~binary~ to send it as binary.

   ~AS~ selects the kind of result to pass to the callback function ~THEN~, or the kind of result to return for synchronous requests.  It may be:

   -  ~buffer~ to pass the response buffer.
   -  ~binary~ to pass the response body as an undecoded string.
   -  ~string~ to pass the response body as a decoded string.
   -  ~response~ to pass a ~plz-response~ struct.
   -  A function, to pass its return value; it is called in the response buffer, which is narrowed to the response body (suitable for, e.g. ~json-read~).
   -  ~file~ to pass a temporary filename to which the response body has been saved without decoding.
   -  ~(file FILENAME)~ to pass ~FILENAME~ after having saved the response body to it without decoding.  ~FILENAME~ must be a non-existent file; if it exists, it will not be overwritten, and an error will be signaled.

   If ~DECODE~ is non-nil, the response body is decoded automatically.  For binary content, it should be nil.  When ~AS~ is ~binary~, ~DECODE~ is automatically set to nil.

   ~THEN~ is a callback function, whose sole argument is selected above with ~AS~.  Or ~THEN~ may be ~sync~ to make a synchronous request, in which case the result is returned directly.

   ~ELSE~ is an optional callback function called when the request fails with one argument, a ~plz-error~ struct.  If ~ELSE~ is nil, an error is signaled when the request fails, either ~plz-curl-error~ or ~plz-http-error~ as appropriate, with a ~plz-error~ struct as the error data.  For synchronous requests, this argument is ignored.

   ~FINALLY~ is an optional function called without argument after ~THEN~ or ~ELSE~, as appropriate.  For synchronous requests, this argument is ignored.

   ~CONNECT-TIMEOUT~ and ~TIMEOUT~ are a number of seconds that limit how long it takes to connect to a host and to receive a response from a host, respectively.

   ~NOQUERY~ is passed to ~make-process~, which see.

** Queueing

~plz~ provides a simple system for queueing HTTP requests.  First, make a ~plz-queue~ struct by calling ~make-plz-queue~.  Then call ~plz-queue~ with the struct as the first argument, and the rest of the arguments being the same as those passed to ~plz~.  Then call ~plz-run~ to run the queued requests.

All of the queue-related functions return the queue as their value, making them easy to use.  For example:

#+begin_src elisp
  (defvar my-queue (make-plz-queue :limit 2))

  (plz-run
   (plz-queue my-queue
     'get "https://httpbin.org/get?foo=0"
     :then (lambda (body) (message "%s" body))))
#+end_src

Or:

#+begin_src elisp
  (let ((queue (make-plz-queue :limit 2))
        (urls '("https://httpbin.org/get?foo=0"
                "https://httpbin.org/get?foo=1")))
    (plz-run
     (dolist (url urls queue)
       (plz-queue queue 'get url
         :then (lambda (body) (message "%s" body))))))
#+end_src

You may also clear a queue with ~plz-clear~, which cancels any active or queued requests and calls their ~:else~ functions.  And ~plz-length~ returns the number of a queue's active and queued requests.

** Tips

+ You can customize settings in the =plz= group, but this can only be used to adjust a few defaults.  It's not intended that changing or binding global variables be necessary for normal operation.

* Credits

+  Thanks to [[https://github.com/skeeto][Chris Wellons]], author of the [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][Elfeed]] feed reader and the popular blog [[https://nullprogram.com/][null program]], for his invaluable advice, review, and encouragement.

* Development

Bug reports, feature requests, suggestions — /oh my/!

Note that ~plz~ is a young library, and its only client so far is [[https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el][Ement.el]].  There are a variety of HTTP and ~curl~ features it does not yet support, since they have not been needed by the author.  Patches are welcome, as long as they include passing tests.

** Info export options

#+TEXINFO_DIR_CATEGORY: Emacs
#+TEXINFO_DIR_TITLE: Plz: (plz)
#+TEXINFO_DIR_DESC: HTTP library using Curl as a backend

# NOTE: We could use these, but that causes a pointless error, "org-compile-file: File "..README.info" wasn't produced...", so we just rename the files in the after-save-hook instead.
# #+TEXINFO_FILENAME: plz.info
# #+EXPORT_FILE_NAME: plz.texi

** File-local variables

# NOTE: Setting org-comment-string buffer-locally is a nasty hack to work around GitHub's org-ruby's HTML rendering, which does not respect noexport tags.  The only way to hide this tree from its output is to use the COMMENT keyword, but that prevents Org from processing the export options declared in it.  So since these file-local variables don't affect org-ruby, wet set org-comment-string to an unused keyword, which prevents Org from deleting this tree from the export buffer, which allows it to find the export options in it.  And since org-export does respect the noexport tag, the tree is excluded from the info page.

# Local Variables:
# eval: (require 'org-make-toc)
# after-save-hook: (lambda nil (when (and (require 'ox-texinfo nil t) (org-texinfo-export-to-info)) (delete-file "README.texi") (rename-file "README.info" "plz.info" t)))
