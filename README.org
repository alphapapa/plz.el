~plz~ is an HTTP library for Emacs.  It uses ~curl~ as a backend, which avoids some of the issues with using Emacs's built-in ~url~ library.  It supports both synchronous and asynchronous requests.  Its API is intended to be simple, natural, and expressive.  Its code is intended to be simple and well-organized.  Every feature is tested against [[https://httpbin.org/][httpbin]].

** MELPA

# If you installed from MELPA, you're done.

This library isn't on MELPA yet.

** Manual

 ~plz~ has no dependencies other than Emacs and ~curl~.  It's known to work on Emacs 26.3 or later.  Simply place =plz.el= in your ~load-path~ and ~(require 'plz)~.

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      :depth 1
:END:

The only public function is ~plz~, which sends an HTTP request and returns either the result of the specified type (for a synchronous request), or the ~curl~ process object (for asynchronous requests).  For asynchronous requests, callback, error-handling, and finalizer functions may be specified, as well as various other options.

** Examples

Synchronously =GET= a URL and return the response body as a decoded string (here, raw JSON):

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :exports both :results value code
  (plz 'get "https://httpbin.org/user-agent")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  "{\n \"user-agent\": \"curl/7.35.0\"\n}\n"
#+END_SRC

Synchronously =GET= a URL that returns a JSON object, and parse and return it as an alist:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :exports both :results value code
  (plz 'get "https://httpbin.org/get" :as #'json-read)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  ((args)
   (headers
    (Accept . "*/*")
    (Accept-Encoding . "deflate, gzip")
    (Host . "httpbin.org")
    (User-Agent . "curl/7.35.0"))
   (url . "https://httpbin.org/get"))
#+END_SRC

Asynchronously =POST= a JSON object in the request body, then parse a JSON object from the response body, and call a function with the result:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :exports both
  (plz 'post "https://httpbin.org/post"
    :headers '(("Content-Type" . "application/json"))
    :body (json-encode '(("key" . "value")))
    :as #'json-read
    :then (lambda (alist)
            (message "Result: %s" (alist-get 'data alist))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Result: {"key":"value"}

Synchronously download a JPEG file, then create an Emacs image object from the data:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :exports both
  (let ((jpeg-data (plz 'get "https://httpbin.org/image/jpeg" :as 'binary)))
    (create-image jpeg-data nil 'data))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: (image :type jpeg :data ""ÿØÿà^@^PJFIF...")

** Functions

+  ~plz~ :: /(method url &key headers body else finally noquery (as 'string) (then 'sync) (body-type 'text) (decode t decode-s) (connect-timeout plz-connect-timeout) (timeout plz-timeout))/

   Request ~METHOD~ from ~URL~ with curl.  Return the curl process object or, for a synchronous request, the selected result.

   ~HEADERS~ may be an alist of extra headers to send with the request.

   ~BODY-TYPE~ may be ~text~ to send ~BODY~ as text, or ~binary~ to send it as binary.

   ~AS~ selects the kind of result to pass to the callback function ~THEN~, or the kind of result to return for synchronous requests.  It may be:

   -  ~buffer~ to pass the response buffer.
   -  ~binary~ to pass the response body as an undecoded string.
   -  ~string~ to pass the response body as a decoded string.
   -  ~response~ to pass a ~plz-response~ struct.
   -  A function, to pass its return value; it is called in the response buffer, which is narrowed to the response body (suitable for, e.g. ~json-read~).
   -  ~file~ to pass a temporary filename to which the response body has been saved without decoding.
   -  ~(file FILENAME)~ to pass ~FILENAME~ after having saved the response body to it without decoding.  ~FILENAME~ must be a non-existent file; if it exists, it will not be overwritten, and an error will be signaled.

   If ~DECODE~ is non-nil, the response body is decoded automatically.  For binary content, it should be nil.  When ~AS~ is ~binary~, ~DECODE~ is automatically set to nil.

   ~THEN~ is a callback function, whose sole argument is selected above with ~AS~.  Or ~THEN~ may be ~sync~ to make a synchronous request, in which case the result is returned directly.

   ~ELSE~ is an optional callback function called when the request fails with one argument, a ~plz-error~ struct.  If ~ELSE~ is nil, an error is signaled when the request fails, either ~plz-curl-error~ or ~plz-http-error~ as appropriate, with a ~plz-error~ struct as the error data.  For synchronous requests, this argument is ignored.

   ~FINALLY~ is an optional function called without argument after ~THEN~ or ~ELSE~, as appropriate.  For synchronous requests, this argument is ignored.

   ~CONNECT-TIMEOUT~ and ~TIMEOUT~ are a number of seconds that limit how long it takes to connect to a host and to receive a response from a host, respectively.

   ~NOQUERY~ is passed to ~make-process~, which see.

+ You can customize settings in the =plz= group, but this can only be used to adjust a few defaults.  It's not intended that changing or binding global variables be necessary for normal operation.

* Development

Bug reports, feature requests, suggestions — /oh my/!

~plz~ is a young library, and its only client so far is [[https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el][Ement.el]].  There are a variety of HTTP and ~curl~ features it does not yet support, since they have not yet been needed by the author.  Patches are welcome, as long as they include passing tests.
