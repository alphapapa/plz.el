(http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/plz.html)

   ‘plz’ is an HTTP library for Emacs.  It uses ‘curl’ as a backend,
which avoids some of the issues with using Emacs’s built-in ‘url’
library.  It supports both synchronous and asynchronous requests.  Its
API is intended to be simple, natural, and expressive.  Its code is
intended to be simple and well-organized.  Every feature is tested
against httpbin (https://httpbin.org/).

File: README.info,  Node: GNU ELPA,  Next: Manual,  Up: Installation

1.1 GNU ELPA
============

‘plz’ is available in GNU ELPA (http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/plz.html).
It may be installed in Emacs using the ‘package-install’ command.


File: README.info,  Node: Manual,  Prev: GNU ELPA,  Up: Installation

1.2 Manual
==========

‘plz’ has no dependencies other than Emacs and ‘curl’.  It’s known to
work on Emacs 26.3 or later.  To install it manually, simply place
‘plz.el’ in your ‘load-path’ and ‘(require 'plz)’.

2 Usage
*******

The main public function is ‘plz’, which sends an HTTP request and
returns either the result of the specified type (for a synchronous
request), or the ‘curl’ process object (for asynchronous requests).  For
asynchronous requests, callback, error-handling, and finalizer functions
may be specified, as well as various other options.

2.1 Examples
============

Synchronously ‘GET’ a URL and return the response body as a decoded
string (here, raw JSON):

     (plz 'get "https://httpbin.org/user-agent")

     "{\n \"user-agent\": \"curl/7.35.0\"\n}\n"

   Synchronously ‘GET’ a URL that returns a JSON object, and parse and
return it as an alist:

     (plz 'get "https://httpbin.org/get" :as #'json-read)

     ((args)
      (headers
       (Accept . "*/*")
       (Accept-Encoding . "deflate, gzip")
       (Host . "httpbin.org")
       (User-Agent . "curl/7.35.0"))
      (url . "https://httpbin.org/get"))

   Asynchronously ‘POST’ a JSON object in the request body, then parse a
JSON object from the response body, and call a function with the result:

     (plz 'post "https://httpbin.org/post"
       :headers '(("Content-Type" . "application/json"))
       :body (json-encode '(("key" . "value")))
       :as #'json-read
       :then (lambda (alist)
               (message "Result: %s" (alist-get 'data alist))))

     Result: {"key":"value"}

   Synchronously download a JPEG file, then create an Emacs image object
from the data:

     (let ((jpeg-data (plz 'get "https://httpbin.org/image/jpeg" :as 'binary)))
       (create-image jpeg-data nil 'data))

     (image :type jpeg :data ""ÿØÿà^@^PJFIF...")

2.2 Functions
=============

‘plz’
     _(method url &key headers body else finally noquery (as ’string)
     (then ’sync) (body-type ’text) (decode t decode-s) (connect-timeout
     plz-connect-timeout) (timeout plz-timeout))_

     Request ‘METHOD’ from ‘URL’ with curl.  Return the curl process
     object or, for a synchronous request, the selected result.

     ‘HEADERS’ may be an alist of extra headers to send with the
     request.

     ‘BODY-TYPE’ may be ‘text’ to send ‘BODY’ as text, or ‘binary’ to
     send it as binary.

     ‘AS’ selects the kind of result to pass to the callback function
     ‘THEN’, or the kind of result to return for synchronous requests.
     It may be:

        • ‘buffer’ to pass the response buffer.
        • ‘binary’ to pass the response body as an undecoded string.
        • ‘string’ to pass the response body as a decoded string.
        • ‘response’ to pass a ‘plz-response’ struct.
        • A function, to pass its return value; it is called in the
          response buffer, which is narrowed to the response body
          (suitable for, e.g.  ‘json-read’).
        • ‘file’ to pass a temporary filename to which the response body
          has been saved without decoding.
        • ‘(file FILENAME)’ to pass ‘FILENAME’ after having saved the
          response body to it without decoding.  ‘FILENAME’ must be a
          non-existent file; if it exists, it will not be overwritten,
          and an error will be signaled.

     If ‘DECODE’ is non-nil, the response body is decoded automatically.
     For binary content, it should be nil.  When ‘AS’ is ‘binary’,
     ‘DECODE’ is automatically set to nil.

     ‘THEN’ is a callback function, whose sole argument is selected
     above with ‘AS’.  Or ‘THEN’ may be ‘sync’ to make a synchronous
     request, in which case the result is returned directly.

     ‘ELSE’ is an optional callback function called when the request
     fails with one argument, a ‘plz-error’ struct.  If ‘ELSE’ is nil,
     an error is signaled when the request fails, either
     ‘plz-curl-error’ or ‘plz-http-error’ as appropriate, with a
     ‘plz-error’ struct as the error data.  For synchronous requests,
     this argument is ignored.

     ‘FINALLY’ is an optional function called without argument after
     ‘THEN’ or ‘ELSE’, as appropriate.  For synchronous requests, this
     argument is ignored.

     ‘CONNECT-TIMEOUT’ and ‘TIMEOUT’ are a number of seconds that limit
     how long it takes to connect to a host and to receive a response
     from a host, respectively.

     ‘NOQUERY’ is passed to ‘make-process’, which see.


File: README.info,  Node: Queueing,  Next: Tips,  Prev: Functions,  Up: Usage

2.3 Queueing
============

‘plz’ provides a simple system for queueing HTTP requests.  First, make
a ‘plz-queue’ struct by calling ‘make-plz-queue’.  Then call ‘plz-queue’
with the struct as the first argument, and the rest of the arguments
being the same as those passed to ‘plz’.  Then call ‘plz-run’ to run the
queued requests.

   All of the queue-related functions return the queue as their value,
making them easy to use.  For example:

     (defvar my-queue (make-plz-queue :limit 2))

     (plz-run
      (plz-queue my-queue
        'get "https://httpbin.org/get?foo=0"
        :then (lambda (body) (message "%s" body))))

   Or:

     (let ((queue (make-plz-queue :limit 2))
           (urls '("https://httpbin.org/get?foo=0"
                   "https://httpbin.org/get?foo=1")))
       (plz-run
        (dolist (url urls queue)
          (plz-queue queue 'get url
            :then (lambda (body) (message "%s" body))))))

   You may also clear a queue with ‘plz-clear’, which cancels any active
or queued requests and calls their ‘:else’ functions.  And ‘plz-length’
returns the number of a queue’s active and queued requests.

2.4 Tips
========

   • You can customize settings in the ‘plz’ group, but this can only be
     used to adjust a few defaults.  It’s not intended that changing or
     binding global variables be necessary for normal operation.

5 Development
*************

Bug reports, feature requests, suggestions — _oh my_!

   Note that ‘plz’ is a young library, and its only client so far is
Ement.el (https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el).  There are a variety
of HTTP and ‘curl’ features it does not yet support, since they have not
been needed by the author.  Patches are welcome, as long as they include
passing tests.
